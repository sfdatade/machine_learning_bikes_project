The choice of z-score range to use when identifying outliers using the z-score method is somewhat subjective and may depend on the specific characteristics of your data and your analysis goals.

For example, if your data has a very wide distribution or contains extreme values, you may want to use a larger z-score range to identify outliers. Conversely, if your data has a very narrow distribution or contains few extreme values, you may want to use a smaller z-score range to avoid identifying too many false positives as outliers.\n",
